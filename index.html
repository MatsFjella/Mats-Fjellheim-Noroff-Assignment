    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p class="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p class="web-security-answer">[First i would advise to using Two-Factor Authentication, this to stop for example brute force attacks, this can be done easily by integrating with Google auth, OneLogin and other third party applications. Secondly and probably one of the most important steps is where do you host your sites? make sure to use a reliable host provider that has good security on they're servers with preffrebly wired nodes. In addition to this using for example CloudFlare to help with DDoS attacks and setting up timeouts for repetead actions to block MySQL injections are good ideas aswell.]</p>
